  First be sure to run pod repo update to get the latest version available.
  Add pod 'CoreLocationDemo' to your Podfile and run pod install. Also add use_frameworks! to the Podfile.
  
  * target 'MyApp'

# Updated for Swift 4
  Swift 4 Version
  
# Requirements

  * ARC
  
# Installation

  * add the key "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription" if you want to access the user's location normally while running in the foreground.

# How to use - FetchLocation Class
  * Just use the function which am using in the ViewController Class:- self.fetchUserCurrentLocation(). You have to use this function in your viewController or any other class. You will get the current location of that particular location.

# How to use - Get real time location by Completion Block
  * Just call the below function in your ViewController Class
   
   
   
   import CoreLocation
   
   class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    var userCoords = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 0, longitude: 0)

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        //Fetch User Current Location
        self.fetchUserCurrentLocation()
    }
    
    func fetchUserCurrentLocation() {
        
        let locationFetch = FetchLocation.SharedManager
        locationFetch.parentObject = self
        locationFetch.startUpdatingLocation()
        locationFetch.completionBlock = { [unowned self] (userCoordinates, error) in
            
            if error != nil {
                print(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
            }
            
            if let userLocation = userCoordinates as? CLLocationCoordinate2D {
                print(userLocation.latitude, userLocation.longitude)
                self.userCoords = userLocation
            }
        }
    }
